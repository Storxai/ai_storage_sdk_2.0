# Solana AI Storage SDK

The **Solana AI Storage SDK** integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized storage on the **Solana blockchain**. This SDK provides various features, including AI-powered file compression, anomaly detection, cost prediction, and seamless integration with Solana's blockchain for file metadata storage.

## **Key Features**

- **AI-Powered Compression**: Leverage machine learning models to compress files intelligently, reducing storage size without significant loss of quality.
- **Anomaly Detection for File Security**: Use pre-trained AI models to detect anomalous file behaviors, providing an extra layer of security for your stored data.
- **Cost Prediction**: Predict storage costs based on AI-driven analysis, helping users optimize their storage budgets by estimating fees based on usage.
- **Solana Blockchain Integration**: Store file metadata (e.g., hash, size, encryption status) on Solana, ensuring secure and decentralized management of your storage assets.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure that the following are installed on your machine:

1. **Python 3.x** – For running the AI models.
2. **Solana CLI** – For interacting with the Solana blockchain.
3. **Node.js and npm** – For managing the JavaScript/TypeScript client and dependencies.
4. **pip** – For Python package management.

### **Install Required Software**

- **Solana CLI**: Follow the guide for [installing Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
- **Node.js and npm**: Download from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Python 3.x**: Download from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

## **Installation**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/solana-ai-storage-sdk.git
cd solana-ai-storage-sdk
```

### 2. **Install Python Dependencies**

The SDK requires several Python libraries. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Install Node.js Dependencies**

The TypeScript client requires the Solana Web3.js library for blockchain interaction. Install it via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. **Download or Train Models**

Place the pre-trained `.pkl` files (AI models) into the `models/` directory. These models are used for file compression, anomaly detection, and cost prediction. If you need to train your own models, refer to the **Training Models** section.

### 5. **Set Up Solana Environment**

To interact with the Solana blockchain, set up the Solana CLI and deploy your smart contract (program):

1. Install Solana CLI: Follow the [Solana CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
2. Set up Solana Devnet (or Mainnet) for testing:

   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   ```

3. **Deploy Solana Program**

   Navigate to the `src/solana_smart_contracts/storage_program/` directory and follow the instructions in **`instructions.md`** to build and deploy your smart contract to Solana.

   ```bash
   cargo build-bpf
   solana program deploy ./target/deploy/storage_program.so
   ```

4. After deploying, you'll receive a **Program ID**. Replace `"YOUR_PROGRAM_ID"` in the **client.ts** file with this Program ID to interact with your deployed contract.

## **Usage**

### **Running AI Models Locally**

Once the setup is complete, you can use the AI models for file compression, security analysis, and cost prediction.

```python
from src.ai_compression import AICompression
from src.ai_security import AISecurity
from src.ai_cost_prediction import AICostPrediction

# AI Compression Example
compression = AICompression()
compressed_file = compression.compress_file("example.png", "image", "compressed_example.jpg")
print(f"Compressed file saved to: {compressed_file}")

# AI Security Example
security = AISecurity()
is_anomaly = security.analyze_file("example.png")
print(f"File Anomaly Detected: {is_anomaly}")

# AI Cost Prediction Example
cost_prediction = AICostPrediction()
predicted_cost = cost_prediction.predict_cost(500)  # Example: Predict cost for 500GB storage
print(f"Predicted cost: ${predicted_cost}")
```

### **Interacting with Solana**

The client allows you to store file metadata (e.g., file hash, size, etc.) on Solana's blockchain. Here’s an example of how to store file metadata:

```typescript
import { Connection, PublicKey, Transaction, SystemProgram } from "@solana/web3.js";
import { sendTransaction } from './utils/solana_helpers';

const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
const programId = new PublicKey("YOUR_PROGRAM_ID");  // Replace with your deployed program ID

async function storeFileMetadata(fileHash: string) {
    const transaction = new Transaction().add(
        SystemProgram.transfer({
            fromPubkey: YOUR_WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY,
            toPubkey: programId,
            lamports: 1000,  // Example fee for file registration
        })
    );

    const signature = await sendTransaction(connection, transaction, YOUR_WALLET_KEYPAIR);
    console.log("Transaction sent:", signature);
}
```

## **AI Model Details**

### **AI Compression (PCA Model)**

The compression model uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of image data. This is done by flattening the image, reducing its size, and saving it back with minimal loss of quality.

### **Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)**

The security model uses **Isolation Forest**, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to detect anomalies in file behavior. If a file exhibits suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual size or access frequency), it is flagged as an anomaly.

### **Cost Prediction (Linear Regression)**

The cost prediction model uses **Linear Regression** to estimate the storage cost based on the amount of storage used. This helps users plan and optimize their storage usage.

## **Training Models**

If you need to train the AI models yourself, you can follow these steps:

1. **AI Compression Model**:
   - Use **PCA** from **scikit-learn** to create the compression model.
   - Save the model using **joblib**.

2. **AI Security Model**:
   - Use **Isolation Forest** from **scikit-learn** to train the anomaly detection model.
   - Save the model using **joblib**.

3. **AI Cost Prediction Model**:
   - Use **Linear Regression** to predict storage costs.
   - Save the model using **joblib**.

## **Testing and Debugging**

- Test each module locally before deploying it to production.
- Use mock data to simulate interactions with Solana to ensure that the blockchain integration works smoothly.
- Use `pytest` for unit testing the Python modules and `mocha` for testing the TypeScript client.
